 Japan's most powerful business lobby on Thursday called on member companies to introduce a four-day workweek and seek flexible ways to hold upcoming shareholders' meetings as part of guidelines on how to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The Japan Business Federation, known as Keidanren, and about 80 other industrial groups compiled guidelines for reducing the risk of virus infection in the workplace, as the government the same day lifted a state of emergency for 39 of the country's 47 prefectures, a move that will restart economic activity. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared in early April a one-month state of emergency until May 6 for seven urban areas hit hard by the virus and expanded it to the whole country on April 16 and extended it to May 31. Among other business groups, the Japan Foodservice Association, which represents restaurant operators, suggested seating layouts in which customers would not face each other and the installation of acrylic sheets between tables. "It's important that each restaurant come up with its own steps (to prevent infections) as the situation differs from one to another," Shinichiro Takaoka, head of the association said at a press conference. An Osaka-based cooperative union of pachinko parlors proposed offering numbered tickets to prevent customers from lining up before the opening, as well reducing the volume of in-store music so people do not need to speak loudly to each other at close proximity.
